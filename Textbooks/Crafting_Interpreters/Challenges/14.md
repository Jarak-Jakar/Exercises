# Chapter Fourteen Challenges

## 14.2

The most obvious issue with defining/using two instructions is that it increases the overall complexity of the compiler, and places a larger maintenance burden on all future work with it.  There's also a potential in that, if you have some sort of fixed number of possible instructions, then you consume more of your allocation replicating similar functionality.  It's the sort of thing you'd only address once it becomes an issue, but it *could* happen.  If it does happen, you'd probably have to look at coalescing the instructions into a single form of them all.  Which is probably how a lot of CISC instructions were originally born.

## 14.3

It turns out that implementing `malloc` and friends very quickly gets *quite* complicated, so I don't think I'm going to attempt the "hardcore mode" here.  I mean, I don't think Lox is supposed to have threading, so we don't need to worry about arenas and the like, but once you get to considering how to handle heap fragmentation and the like things get tricky.

On the topic of the posed question, I found a number of references online discussing the matter, e.g.

It seems that the GNU implementation of `malloc` & friends, as contained in glibc, is based upon `ptmalloc`, which itself was derived from `dlmalloc`.  The allocated or free status of a memory chunk is handled by using a bitflag on a specific memory word in the chunk.

The process of allocating a chunk is somewhat complicated, depending on the size of memory you need.  Basically, it seems that `malloc` will examine how much memory you request, and then figure out from there which pool of chunks to use.  It appears that the different pools are all tracked using either singly- or doubly-linked lists.  The smallest chunks are all the same size, and so the system uses a singly-linked list where you can always just supply the most-recently-returned chunk back (which is quite possibly good for cache-friendliness).  For the larger chunks, the system will go through more of a process to try to get the right size of chunk, *and* attempt to ensure that the heap doesn't become too fragmented.

Freeing the memory is somewhat the mirror of allocating it.  If it's the fixed-sized chunks, then it'll just slap one onto the end of the list.  Apparently, for the larger chunks, they are stacked into some sort of unsorted grouping, and then during an appropriate call to `malloc`, they'll be sorted and re-combined where possible.  At least, that's my reading of it.  I could well be wrong.

Of course, you *can* have simpler implementations, but they're probably not going to work very well for any long-running program, I suspect.  Unless perhaps it very much has a steady state of heap memory usage.  Admittedly, some of those simple implementations really do seem to be remarkably simple.
