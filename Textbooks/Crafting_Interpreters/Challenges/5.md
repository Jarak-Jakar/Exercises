If I'm understanding this challenge correctly, then the concept of extension methods as found in C# strikes me as yielding the requirement.  Which is basically the same semantically (so far as I can tell) as how Rust and Go implement methods.  As in, you can define your type as you please, then separately to that define functions which take an instance of the type and do some operation relying on data in the type.  The two challenges I can think of are that you don't get dot notation, and if the type has private/hidden/etc members, the functions may not get access to those.  ðŸ¤”
