# Chapter Eight Challenges

## 8.1

Programming challenge, to be completed in Jlox.  Not that I'm sure at this moment quite how I will do it.

I expected it to print "3", since the inner `a` would shadow the outer `a`.  This sort of shadowing is entirely normal in F#, although opinions on how appropriate it may be are mixed (especially if said shadowing is done to variables declared inside a function's scope, rather than shadowing the arguments of the function once at the start).  I can't for the life of me remember about other languages right now.  Of course, this doesn't even make sense in something like Python, where there is no difference whatsoever between declaring a variable with an assignment, and re-assigning to a variable...

As for what _other_ users might expect it to do:  I anticipate that, by and large, Lox users will expect one of two possibilities.  Either they will expect the aforementioned shadowing, or they will expect an error because they have attempted to declare a variable name that is already in scope.  I really can't figure out what else (and why) someone might expect.

Given that this sort of thing is completely possible in F#, I think the shadowing is reasonable, but I certainly can appreciate the viewpoint that this should just be an error.
