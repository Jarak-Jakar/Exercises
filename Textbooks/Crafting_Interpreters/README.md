My answers/solutions to the challenges presented at the end of each chapter of *Crafting Interpreters* by Bob Nystrom.  I am reading through the paperback edition, but using the online web version as the reference for the challenges.

## Development Environments & Editors

I use Windows for my day-to-day computating, which sometimes necessitates using things like containers (e.g. Docker) or virtual machines, either directly through something like Virtualbox, or indirectly through something like Vagrant.

### Java

#### Environment

TBD.

#### Editor

TBD.

### C

#### Environment

I simply used the latest version of GCC available in my chosen [WSL distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows/wsl/about).  There wasn't really any point in fussing around with something more advanced or complicated for relatively simple C programming.  In my case, I have been using the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed distro, but I don't think there's any terribly significant differences between them for these purposes.

#### Editor

I used Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ extension published by Microsoft.

## Future Efforts?

I *might* come back in the future and make my own re-implementations of a Lox interpreter in other languages that interest me.  Especially if they claim to be a systems programming language (e.g. Rust, Zig, D to name some relatively current ones).
