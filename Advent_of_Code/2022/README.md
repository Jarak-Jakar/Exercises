# Advent of Code 2022

This directory contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).  I have started off solving them in [F#](https://fsharp.org/), since it's my favourite language.  Specifically, I have written them as Linqpad scripts, since that lets me write the solutions in F#, but makes running things convenient and easy (relatively speaking).  I could have simply used .fsx scripts, but honestly I think using Linqpad is easier on the whole.

## Other solutions

See the below lists for known other solutions to at least some of the solutions.  Obviously, there will be millions more of them out there, but these are the ones which I have (probably) actually looked at in the course of completing it myself.  I don't vouch for the 'quality' of the listed solutions, but at least weren't so terrible that they offended my sensibilities and I banished them from the readme.  None of the listings are presented in any particular order.
